# testStructAnalyzer
Only some older test to begin building structAnalyzer and version-compare-merger (4Dv18R3 Binary).
Just a collection of experiments to clarify in advance what to do and how can solve it or where it would get complicated.

#### Now with a new little TOKENs-Feature
- Hide tokens (do not use the tokens when some tokens in originalSrc exists)
- Show orginal (with or without tokens belongs to orginalSrc)
- Regenerate tokens (recreate the tokens by current 4Dversion and DBversion)

(Note: Photo from old version, commands like "Table name" or "Field name" detected+colored in all cases now correct)
